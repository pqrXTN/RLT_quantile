<!-- badges: end -->

This is a new version (>= 4.0.0) of the `RLT` package. Versions prior to 4.0.0 are written in `C` (available at [RLT-Archive](https://github.com/teazrq/RLT-Archive)), while newer versions are based on `C++`. This new version will replace the original CRAN package once it is finished. 

The goal of `RLT` is to provide new functionalities of random forest models. This includes embedded model fit learning a better splitting rule; linear combination splits, confidence intervals, and several other new approaches that are currently being developed.
